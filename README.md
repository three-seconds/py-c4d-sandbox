# py-c4d-sandbox
Collection of different python scripts, generators, tags for Cinema4D

The files are separated in folders named by their different python usage: As tag, in a generator, as effector or within xpresso.
The scripts definitely aren't perfect. They all have their flaws and most of them had quite a special usage within the GUNEE Homme Project (https://vimeo.com/326856047). 

If you have any question, just drop me a line at www.three-seconds.de

Open Source:

The Scripts are free to use, whether in commercial or non-commercial projects. They are mainly intended for educational use, to help you get started with Python-C4D to use it more frequently in your personal workflow. If you improve some of the scripts, reused it or just helped you out in your project, let me know, I'd love to see it.
